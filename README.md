## ðŸŽ¯ What is Captain?
Captain is a slack bot that allows you to automatically pick a random channel member, for example to moderate daily standup meeting.

1. Add Captain to the channel
2. Setup a schedule using the `/setup` command with the CRON syntax
3. Let Captain pick a random member(s) for you
4. Optionally use the `/pick` command to pick a random member immediately

Captain will pick up to two human channel members in case one of them is unavailable.
